“All I did was lower the activation energy required for the reaction to take place, but if I don’t have an amazing substrate like starch to act upon, there is no reaction, period,” said the modest catabolic enzyme, adding that it’s easy to forget about the calcium ion, chloride ion, and the 496 amino-acid residues that all need to come together to make this biomolecule possible. ﻿BOSTON Calling itself “just a catalyst, nothing more,” humbled enzyme α-amylase confirmed Monday that while its contributions to a recent biochemical reaction significantly sped up the breakdown of starch into maltose, the formation of the
